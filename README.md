## Abstract

Nowadays, a big part of engineers everyday work is supported by highly sophisticated
computational tools, essential to achieve the highest level of productivity.

However, experience shows that many times it is necessary to perform manual work,
be it for transforming the output of one tool into the input of another tool,
to repeat a specific analysis with slight variations, to execute a task for which
the tools at our disposal were not designed, or simply to deliver results to
internal or external clients according to some formatting requirements.

In these seminars we will study how computer programming in general, and the
Python programming language in particular, are used today in the Aerospace industry
to solve these problems, we will describe the lifecycle of software projects
following modern reproducibility and quality standards, and we will justify that
engineering students should delve into the possibilities of computing
as another element in their toolbox.

## Sessions

1. Use of Python in science and engineering, introduction to the ecosystem
2. Lifecycle of a software project: development, tests, packaging, deployment, monitoring
